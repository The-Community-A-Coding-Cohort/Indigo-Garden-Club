- **RESTful APIs:** Integrating external data sources with API calls.
- **Version Control with Git & GitHub:** Managing code changes and collaborating effectively.
- **Code Quality Practices:** Enforcing consistency with ESLint and best practices.
- **Deployment:** Publishing the final project on AWS using Terraform via GitHub Actions.
