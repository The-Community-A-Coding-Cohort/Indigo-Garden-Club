## Deployment üöÄ

### Install Dependencies

To install node follow this guide for node version manager [nvm installation](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/). Or if you are on mac simply do
```bash
brew install node
```

Remember to first change your directory to either netflixclone or IndigoGardenCinemaClub or these commands will not work.

```bash
npm install
npx prisma generate
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### Docker

To install Docker follow [this guide for Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyBBv1JmnWQ). If you are on mac simply install [at the official site](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/). If you're on linux you can figure it out.

Docker is the fastest way to get both the current and the legacy app running locally at the same time. The legacy will run at port 3000 and the newer version will run at port 3001. Simply run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
